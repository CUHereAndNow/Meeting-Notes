-Front and Back end integration is in a working state. The website can display information from our databases under their
 designated building tabs. Users are able to login, add their own singular tag, logout, and still beable to see their single tags.

-An interactive map has been created and may be able to implement some of the functions we wanted when starting. For instance
 a clickable map that displays the buildings specific resources. Hopefully, within the next week, this map can be implemented.

-Their are only a few bugs that need to be ironed out in our fallback project plan.

-Otherwise, DOING WELL!
