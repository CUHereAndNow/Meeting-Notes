*** CU students
    CU Here&Now
    - Google maps, but detailed CU resources (printers, ATM, etc.)
    - Have updates/suggestions
    - Colanders: pull/compile events.
    - Generally: foot work needed.  Ask building managers (what is not being utilized?)
    THIS IS THE ONE WE ARE DOING
*** CU Boulder Ebay
    - Sell textbooks to replace the textbook buyback.
** Something Cool
*** Sports Program
    - Tournament Organizer (brackets)
    - Keeps track of stats (manual entry)
    - Extended
    - Generalized
    - GUI is really important! (and that is no fun)
*** Rendering Engine
